# Pong Game Cordova App

## Description
This Cordova app is a classic implementation of the popular Pong game. Pong is a two-player sports game that simulates table tennis. Players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen and use them to hit a ball back and forth. The objective is to score points by making the ball go past the opponent's paddle.

This app provides an enjoyable gaming experience with simple controls, smooth animations, and responsive gameplay. It is built using Cordova, a platform for developing mobile applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
